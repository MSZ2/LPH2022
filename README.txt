SUMA Hackaton 2022

Team 'Los Pollos Hermanos'

So, you've seen Atlantis, ancient Egyptian gods, pirates and their jewels and treasures?
You've had to learn the ins and outs of paytables, paylines and the rules of those games, which all make us tired.
Would you like to feel at home?
Come down to the Los Pollos Hermanos, enjoy some of our delicious food, push the big chicken button with your greasy fingers and enjoy!

It's deliciously simple, just like Mama used to make 'em.
